hello guys, if you are reading this, you have a lot of patience.
Actually I dk what to do with Github
I also dk what are repositories...
Can someone explain?

Hello haridevcodes, I am 8thcoder and I am glad I was ahving the patience to reach ere lol.
So answering your questions, what is github? Its just a place where developers interact with each other and help out each other like I am doing right now. You can continuosly work on your project and other devs can come and spot errors or help you.
Repository is the file in which your current project is saved. For exapmple Zen is your repository where you have 2 files.
I hope you understand and yeah, WELCOME TO GITHUB :)
